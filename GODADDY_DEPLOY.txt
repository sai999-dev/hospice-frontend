  DEPLOY DIST FILES TO GODADDY - STEP BY STEP GUIDE
================================================================================

STEP 1: PREPARE DIST FILES
---------------------------
1. Open the "dist" folder in your project
2. You should see these files:
   - index.html
   - robots.txt
   - sitemap.xml
   - assets/ (folder with CSS, JS, images)

IMPORTANT: Upload ALL contents of the dist folder, not the folder itself!


STEP 2: ACCESS GODADDY FILE MANAGER
------------------------------------
1. Log into GoDaddy: https://www.godaddy.com
2. Go to "My Products" → "Web Hosting"
3. Click "Manage" next to your hosting plan
4. Find "File Manager" or "cPanel File Manager"
5. Click to open File Manager


STEP 3: NAVIGATE TO PUBLIC_HTML
--------------------------------
1. In File Manager, navigate to the root directory
2. Look for folder named:
   - "public_html" (most common)
   - "www"
   - "httpdocs"
   - Or root folder "/"

IMPORTANT: This is where your website files should be!


STEP 4: BACKUP EXISTING FILES (IF ANY)
---------------------------------------
1. If there are existing files in public_html:
   - Select all existing files
   - Create a backup folder (e.g., "backup_old_files")
   - Move files to backup folder
   - OR rename public_html to "public_html_old"


STEP 5: UPLOAD DIST FILES
--------------------------
Method 1: Upload via File Manager (Recommended for small projects)
1. In public_html folder, click "Upload" button
2. Select all files from your dist folder:
   - index.html
   - robots.txt
   - sitemap.xml
3. Upload the entire assets/ folder (with all its contents)
4. Wait for upload to complete

Method 2: Upload via FTP (Faster for large files)
1. Get FTP credentials from GoDaddy:
   - GoDaddy → Hosting → FTP Account Details
2. Use FTP client (FileZilla, WinSCP, etc.)
3. Connect to your server
4. Navigate to public_html
5. Upload all files from dist folder


STEP 6: VERIFY FILE STRUCTURE
------------------------------
After upload, your public_html should look like:
   public_html/
   ├── index.html
   ├── robots.txt
   ├── sitemap.xml
   └── assets/
       ├── index-xxxxx.js
       ├── index-xxxxx.css
       └── [other assets]

IMPORTANT: 
- index.html MUST be in the root (public_html/)
- robots.txt MUST be in the root (public_html/)
- sitemap.xml MUST be in the root (public_html/)
- assets/ folder should be in the root (public_html/assets/)


STEP 7: SET FILE PERMISSIONS (If needed)
-----------------------------------------
1. Select index.html → Right-click → Permissions
2. Set to: 644 (or Read/Write for Owner, Read for Others)
3. Select robots.txt → Set to: 644
4. Select sitemap.xml → Set to: 644
5. Select assets/ folder → Set to: 755


STEP 8: TEST YOUR WEBSITE
--------------------------
1. Visit: https://www.hospiceconnectdfw.com/
   ✅ Should show your website

2. Visit: https://www.hospiceconnectdfw.com/robots.txt
   ✅ Should show robots.txt content

3. Visit: https://www.hospiceconnectdfw.com/sitemap.xml
   ✅ Should show sitemap.xml content

4. View Page Source (Right-click → View Page Source):
   ✅ Should see Open Graph meta tags
   ✅ Should see Twitter Card meta tags


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Problem: Website shows 404 or blank page
Solution:
- Check that index.html is in public_html root (not in a subfolder)
- Clear browser cache
- Check file permissions (644 for files, 755 for folders)

Problem: robots.txt or sitemap.xml not accessible
Solution:
- Verify files are in public_html root (not in assets/ folder)
- Check file permissions (should be 644)
- Clear browser cache

Problem: Images/CSS not loading
Solution:
- Verify assets/ folder uploaded correctly
- Check file paths in index.html point to /assets/...
- Clear browser cache

Problem: .htaccess not working (if you added it)
Solution:
- Some GoDaddy plans require enabling mod_rewrite
- Contact GoDaddy support to enable Apache modules
- Or configure through cPanel → Apache Modules


IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
1. Upload contents of dist folder, NOT the dist folder itself
2. All files should be directly in public_html/ (or your root folder)
3. Keep the assets/ folder structure intact
4. Don't modify file names or paths
5. After upload, it may take a few minutes for changes to appear


FILE CHECKLIST
--------------
Before going live, verify these files exist in public_html:
   [ ] index.html
   [ ] robots.txt
   [ ] sitemap.xml
   [ ] assets/ folder (with all CSS, JS, images)

After upload, test these URLs:
   [ ] https://www.hospiceconnectdfw.com/
   [ ] https://www.hospiceconnectdfw.com/robots.txt
   [ ] https://www.hospiceconnectdfw.com/sitemap.xml
